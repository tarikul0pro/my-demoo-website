                <h3>Food produced by farmers or gardeners can be changed by industrial processes (the food industry). </h3>
                <p>
                  Food can also be prepared and served in restaurants or refectory (in particular for children in school).

                  The utensils used may be a plate, knife, fork, chopsticks, spoon, bowl, or spork.
                  
                  Many people do not grow their own food. They have to buy food that was grown by someone else.
